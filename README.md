# ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE PROFILE.

The Earth's atmosphere is relatively trasparent to incoming solar radiation (short-wave radiation), and opaque to outgoing long-wave radiation 
emitted by the Earth's surface and by the atmosphere itself. For this reason part of the outgoing radiation is blocked. Populary this phenomena 
is known as ***greenhouse effect***.

Much of the absorption and reemission of outgoing radiation are due to air molecules, but cloud droplets and aerosol. The atmosphere also scatters
the radiation that passes through it, giving rise to a wide range of optical effects, including the blue color of the sky.

### The Vertical Structure

The density at the sea level is  1.25 ![](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1593036352/render.png). 
Density and pressure decrease nearly exponentially with the height:

### Long-term radiative energy balance of a planet.

The system is assumed to be in a stationary state with energy transfer occurring only by means of radiation. 
Each layer is in radiative energy balance. The equations that describe the energy balance for each layer have this simple structure:
