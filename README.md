# ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE PROFILE.

### Long-term radiative energy balance of a planet.

The system is assumed to be in a stationary state with energy transfer occurring only by means of radiation. 
Each layer is in radiative energy balance. The equations that describe the energy balance for each layer have this simple structure:
